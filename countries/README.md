## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) - For routing
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - For styles
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - For animations

### What I learned

I learned to use framer motion  for animating react apps, I also learnt to use some advanced features of react router

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```

### Continued development

I will be furthering my knowledge in react by building more complex applications.
